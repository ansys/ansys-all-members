# PyAnsys all-members team
Repository for updating the pyansys/all-members team automatically

## How does it work?
This repository basically contains a simple Python script ``update_team.py``. Within this
script, there are two main variables which a user must take into account:

* ``myPAT``: this variable will basically include your personal authentication token in order
to interact with GitHub (using PyGitHub).
* ``myOrg``: the organziation whose team ``all-members`` we want to update.

In order to run it, simply modify these values and run:

```bash
    python update_team.py
```

Bare in mind that this specific version of the script has already set up the ``myOrg`` variable
to ``pyansys``, since it the organization for which this repository is oriented.

## Requirements

In order to run the previous script, one only needs to install ``pygithub``. You can install
the latest version of the package by doing as follows with the ``pip`` package manager:

```bash
    pip install pygithub
```
